#Intermediate R

##Relational Operators
#### The greater string is determined based on alphabetical order
#### TRUE == 1, FALSE == 0

#### The && and || operators returns the first element's logic output. 

#### The parenthesis of the for and the while loop is quite different from python. 

#### The V2 looping is new to e. Utilising ':' in R is still very new for myself. 

#### Knowing how to properly use the break and next statements.

#### ?(function) will allow us to get help about functions

#### ... ellipsis is a way for R to pass arguments along without the fucntion having to name them explicitly. 

#### writing a function in R is also totally different from python. Setting default values to arguments are important to prevent running into an error. 

#### The passing arguments by values part, I am still uncertain. Need to relook again. 

#### using l apply to have the contents and the class names of the list.
