## Week 1
This folder contains the files that are done in class as well as homework.  
* [Class_assignment.Rmd](https://github.com/ericwang1998/CSX_RProject_Summer_2018/blob/master/week_1/Class_assignment.Rmd)
    + This was part of the class activity which enabled us to _create Rmarkdown files_ to present information in a beautiful manner
      we were also told that _we were to submit all our homework in the Rmarkdown format_. 
    + We were also taught that the Rmarkdown file _can be knit into different formats_ for different uses: word documents, PDFs, 
      and even HTML, which we can embed in the web (example shown below)
* [Class_assignment.html](https://ericwang1998.github.io/CSX_RProject_Summer_2018/week_1/Class_assignment.html)
    + This was the final product of our class activity: a functional html file from Rmarkdown that demonstrates the calculation
      capabilities of R. 
    + Plus, we were taught how to link this HTML so that when you click the button above, it runs the HTML on the browser instead of 
      linking you to the HTML script stored on github.
* [HW](https://github.com/ericwang1998/CSX_RProject_Summer_2018/tree/master/week_1/HW)
    + The files stored in this folder are part of the tasks to do at home. Mainly learning points from our adventures on Datacamp.. in
      Rmarkdown files of course. 
      
* Impressions of the course so far:
**Fun | **Awesomeness | **Overall
