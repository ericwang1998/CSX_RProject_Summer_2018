## CSX_RProject_Summer_2018
July 2018 R data analysis bootcamp-style-course - 8N2033

## Self introduction
Hi my name is Eric (王奕傑), Student ID 08359906.  
I am enrolling in Singapore Management University, majoring in information systems, so this is kind of a way for me to prepare for the degree programme.  

Been trying to pick up coding on my own, but find myself like a headless chicken. Did some Lynda.com courses on R but still glad to be able to attend a course that can provide me with more guidance and direction.
