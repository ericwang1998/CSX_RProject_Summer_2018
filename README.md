## Self introduction
Hi my name is Eric (王奕傑), Student ID 08359906. Studying in Singapore Management University majoring in information systems. 

Been trying to pick up coding on my own, but find myself like a headless chicken. Did some Lynda.com courses on R but still glad to be able to attend a course that can provide me with more guidance and direction.
